ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ben Arnold

## Claims and Interests
- My previous assertion that Java's "write-once-run-anywhere" capability is significantly underutilized, given its prevalent use as a web application language, finds itself largely undermined by the licensing and signing complexities associated with modern desktop clients.
- Looking for new ideas to tackle as time allows.

## What I'm reading
- Iâ€™m currently reading "The Well-Grounded Java Software Developer (Second Edition)" by Evans, Clark and Verburg
- I'm still digesting "Artificial Intelligence Algorithms" by Rishal Hurbans 

## Collaborations
- My previous efforts to develop cross-reference tools to make development and other analysis tasks easier are under the [Legyver](https://github.com/Legyver) brand.
 - Gradle plugins
 - JavaFX projects
 - If I'm committing directly to master, it's because I'm the only one working on the project.
