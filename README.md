ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ben Arnold

## Claims and Interests
- Currently prevailing interest is in developing Java desktop clients to aid in solving developement problems.  IE: make my job easier.  Java's write-once-run-anywhere is massively under-utilized given that Java is main used on servers to host web applications.
- Not particularly interested in the applied statistics model taken by AI.  I find myself more drawn to a general metacognitive model that learns as we learn and trains as we train.

## What I'm reading
- Iâ€™m currently reading "The Well-Grounded Java Software Developer (Second Edition)" by Evans, Clark and Verburg

## Collaborations
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on developing cross-reference tools to make development and other analysis tasks easier.  My own efforts in this area are under the [Legyver](https://github.com/Legyver) brand.
