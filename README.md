- 👋 Hi, I’m Ben Arnold
- 👀 I’m interested in general AI algorithms and Java desktop clients.  Java's write-once-run-anywhere is massively under-utilized given that Java is main used on servers to host web applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently reading "Practical Java Programming for IOT, AI and Blockchain" by Perry Xiao
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing cross-reference tools to make development and other analysis tasks easier.  My own efforts in this area are under the [Legyver](https://github.com/Legyver) brand.
